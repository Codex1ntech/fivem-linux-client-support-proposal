## 🎯 Objective

While FiveM already supports **server-side hosting on Linux**, the **client remains Windows-only**. This proposal aims to:

- 🚪 **Reduce platform exclusivity** and embrace open-source ecosystems
- 🧩 **Enhance compatibility** for Linux-based GTA V players using Proton/Wine
- 💻 **Support devs** working natively in Linux environments
- 🕹️ **Expand accessibility** for gamers on alternative operating systems

---

## 🛠️ Proposed Implementation Paths

### 1️⃣ Evaluate Dependencies

- 🔍 Assess critical Windows-only dependencies  
  - Rockstar Launcher, DirectX, system-level hooks  
- 🧠 Identify modules requiring rework or compatibility-layer adaptation

### 2️⃣ Proton/Wine Integration Layer

- 🧪 Build community-maintained installation scripts for Proton
- 🧮 Benchmark stability, latency, and FPS across major Linux distros

### 3️⃣ Partial Native Client Feasibility

- 🛠️ Modular rewrite of specific FiveM client modules
- 🧬 Explore hybrid execution (e.g., native launcher with Wine-based rendering)
- 💬 Investigate open-source alternatives to Windows-only frameworks
