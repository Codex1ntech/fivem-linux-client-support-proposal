# Why FiveM Should Support a Linux Client

As the gaming and development communities shift toward more open, cross-platform ecosystems, supporting Linux as a client OS is no longer optional â€” itâ€™s a forward-facing necessity. This document outlines the strategic and technical benefits of adding Linux client support for FiveM.

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Linux Client Support

### 1. Developer Accessibility
Many game developers and server administrators already use Linux as their primary OS. Supporting the FiveM client allows them to build, test, and experience gameplay natively without switching to Windows.

### 2. Compatibility with Steam Deck and Proton
Valveâ€™s Proton compatibility layer and the Steam Deck are pushing Linux-based gaming into the mainstream. FiveM could benefit from early adaptation and community traction in this growing space.

### 3. Community Expansion
By opening support to Linux users, FiveM can attract:
- Developers building open-source tools
- Modders in Linux-based environments
- Privacy-focused users avoiding Windows telemetry

### 4. Reduced Bottlenecks for Resource Testing
End-to-end testing in a Linux-native environment reduces variability and improves consistency for those deploying on Linux-based servers.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps (Community-Led)

- Evaluate feasibility using Proton or Wine
- Survey active community interest and distro usage
- Identify low-hanging implementation goals (e.g. runtime compatibility)
