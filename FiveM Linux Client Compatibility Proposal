This document presents a proposal to initiate support for running the FiveM client on Linux-based systems. 

While Linux is already supported on the server-side, many users and developers have requested native or improved compatibility for client-side usage. This initiative aims to explore integration paths using Proton, Wine, or possible partial native adaptations.

Topics covered:
- Rationale for Linux client support
- Challenges with current architecture (DirectX, Rockstar Launcher)
- Opportunities using compatibility layers (e.g., Proton)
- Benefits for open-source and multi-platform development
- Reference to the official community request thread
